## My process


### What I learned

Hello guys! more one solution complete.

I managed to adapt better with the relative and absolute position in this code, but I thought I created too many lines of CSS (even trying to remove all possible redundancies)

### Continued development

I intend to continue my coding, especially in CSS and JS, I've been practicing and with practice I'm sure I'll reach excellence
